Description: This repository provides data and scripts to analyze the influence of ocean acidification on larval geoduck (D Hinge) DNA methylation and phenotype. 

##Trial2
Geoduck (~4 days old) were exposed to 2 differnt pH conditions (~7.9 and 7.4) for 6 days. Survivors from pH 7.4 were pooled at day 6 and split into 2 differnt pH conditions (~7.4 and 7.0) and exposed for an additional 4 days. Performance was assessed via growth and survivorship and samples were collected for DNA and RNA analyses. 

##Trial3
Geoduck (~4 days old) were exposed to 2 differnt pH conditions (~7.4 and 7.0) for 5 days. Performance was assessed via growth and survivorship and samples were collected for DNA and RNA analyses.
